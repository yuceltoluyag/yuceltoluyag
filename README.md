# Hey! I’m Yücel Toluyağ 👋

I’m an AI enthusiast who loves to learn by teaching and has a borderline obsession with all things programming ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ).

- 👨‍👧‍👦 I’m a dad of two—basically a full-time debugger for tiny humans. {AsyncAwaitDad}
- 📹 I’m all about sharing knowledge and building cool stuff—because, why not?
- 🎒 Currently wrestling with Node.js and C#, because sleep is overrated.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m that weirdo who loves science fiction, history, and watching how everyday things are made. Yep, I’m the guy who’s fascinated by the riveting process of assembling, well, anything 🛠️.
- 👽 Software development isn’t my day job; it’s just my little playground where I flirt with different languages, commitment-free. Who needs a stable relationship with one language when you can have them all? ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ

## Playlist: ♫♪.ılılıll|̲̅̅●̲̅̅|̲̅̅=̲̅̅|̲̅̅●̲̅̅|llılılı.♫♪

- My ‘sanctuary’ is a fortress of solitude, where I find solace in the dark, deep rhythms that resonate with the core of my being. It is a place where I walk the razor’s edge between order and chaos, finding power in the balance.

- I am the architect of my own reality, and my music reflects that—shifting with the tides of my mood, ever unpredictable, ever powerful. This playlist is a reflection of my inner world: a blend of R&B, pop, rap, blues, techno, deep house, and more. It is chaos, but in that chaos lies true power.
